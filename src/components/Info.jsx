          JeopardyLabs was created by me, Matt Johnson, while working on my
          undergrad at Washington State University, Vancouver. JeopardyLabs
          makes it easy to create jeopardy templates without PowerPoint. Give it
          a try, you'll probably like it a lot. JeopardyLabs is not affiliated
          with Jeopardy!Â® or Sony Pictures Digital Inc.
